# Master Thesis Material

This repository contains additional material to reproduce my experiments, etc.

Please note that the naming of my three different bulk index creation approaches is reversed. Approach 1 (in my thesis) equals Approach 3 in this repository.

- *notebooks*: Google Colab notebook for plotting
- *plots*: generated plots, also plots generated from CPU counters
- *profiling*: CPU traces, script to extract information, and tracetemplate (I used Instruments)
- *scripts*: Python3 scripts to get stats, timings, and generate some data
- *stats*: information about the different data sets
- *timings*: CSV files containing the timings of the different experiments
